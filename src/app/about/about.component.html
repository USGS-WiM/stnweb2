                    Many of the supplemental GIS data layers found in the map
                    are from a range of sources and are not maintained by WiM.
                    We offer these map layers as a decision support supplement
                    to the STN sites layer, but we cannot guarantee their
                    performance and availability. Many of these externally
                    maintained layers are large datasets and may load slowly
                    depending on network latency. In some cases they may fail to
                    load entirely when network latency is high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of these outside layers are maintained by NOAA.
